# Secrets

This project is to demonstrate authentication and encryption methods for user security. 
Users can create an account to post an anonymous secret that will be posted on the /secrets page. 
oAuth for Google accounts can be used for authentication. 
All user passwords are hashed and have gone through 10 rounds of salting.
